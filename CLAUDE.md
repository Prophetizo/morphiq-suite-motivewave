## Project Vision

This project aims to create a **commercial wavelet-based trading analysis package** for MotiveWave, distributed through online stores (Shopify). The goal is to leverage wavelet transforms' unique ability to analyze financial data across multiple time scales simultaneously, providing traders with sophisticated tools for identifying trends, cycles, and trading opportunities.

**Commercial Objective**: Build a premium trading software package with multiple licensing tiers, professional support, and comprehensive customer success infrastructure.

  - Real-time adaptation based on trading session and market conditions
  - Machine learning continuous improvement and performance tracking
  - Multi-scale family (scalping, intraday, swing, news events)
  - Session-specific coefficient optimization (opening, lunch, afternoon, close)
  - Time-of-day and volatility regime adaptive responses
  - Comprehensive backtesting and validation framework
  - Integration with all other wavelet strategies as the ultimate analytical engine

## Architecture Overview

This is a MotiveWave trading platform extension that performs wavelet analysis on financial price data. Key architectural components:

### MotiveWave Integration
- **AutoWavelets** (`src/main/java/com/prophetizo/motivewave/studies/AutoWavelets.java`): Main Study implementation that integrates with MotiveWave
- **DenoisedTrendFollowing** (`src/main/java/com/prophetizo/motivewave/studies/DenoisedTrendFollowing.java`): Wavelet-based denoising for cleaner trend analysis
- Uses Study pattern (not Strategy) for visualization and analysis
- Registered under "Prophetizo, LLC" menu in MotiveWave
- Both studies feature modern dropdown controls via DiscreteDescriptor

### Data Flow Pipelines
```
AutoWavelets:
Price Data ‚Üí AutoWavelets.calculate() ‚Üí WaveletAnalyzer ‚Üí MODWT Transform ‚Üí Plot Coefficients

DenoisedTrendFollowing:
Price Data ‚Üí DenoisedTrendFollowing.calculate() ‚Üí WaveletDenoiser ‚Üí Threshold/Reconstruct ‚Üí Denoised Signal
```

### Core Components
1. **WaveletAnalyzer** (`src/main/java/com/prophetizo/wavelets/WaveletAnalyzer.java`): Wraps JWave's MODWT implementation with configurable wavelet selection
2. **WaveletDenoiser** (`src/main/java/com/prophetizo/wavelets/WaveletDenoiser.java`): Advanced coefficient manipulation with multiple thresholding algorithms
3. **Auto-scaling Logic**: Automatically determines decomposition levels based on bar size (targets ~390 minute trading sessions)
4. **Visualization**: Up to 7 decomposition levels (D1-D7) displayed as colored paths
5. **UI Controls**: DiscreteDescriptor-based dropdown controls for all configuration options

### Key Design Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: WaveletAnalyzer simplifies JWave interface
- **Configuration**: Settings managed through MotiveWave's SettingsDescriptor
- **Logging**: Custom async logging with Logstash JSON encoding

### Dependencies
- **MotiveWave SDK** (20230627): Private GitLab repository - requires authentication
- **JWave** (1.0.6): Wavelet transforms - GitHub packages
- **Java 21+** required

### Maven Configuration
- Shade plugin creates uber-JAR excluding MotiveWave SDK
- Output: `target/motivewave-wavelets-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`

## Development Notes

### Adding New Wavelets
‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Both AutoWavelets and DenoisedTrendFollowing now support configurable wavelet selection via dropdown controls. Current options: Daubechies4, Daubechies6. Additional wavelets can be added by extending the WaveletType enum and updating the dropdown options.

### Testing MotiveWave Integration
The AutoWavelets study cannot be unit tested directly due to MotiveWave SDK dependencies. Test the underlying components (WaveletAnalyzer, Statistics, MovingAverage) instead.

### Logging
Logs written to `/tmp/prophetizo_motivewave.log` with async queue size of 100,000 messages. Configuration in `src/main/resources/logger.properties`.
