This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Morphiq Suite MotiveWave is a multi-module Maven project that provides advanced wavelet-based trading indicators for the MotiveWave platform. The project uses Java 23 and leverages parallel processing for high-performance signal analysis.

## Recent Updates (August 2024)

### Module Consolidation (August 15, 2024)
- **Project Structure Simplified**:
  - Consolidated from 5 modules to 2 modules
  - Removed `morphiq-core`, `morphiq-denoise`, and `morphiq-bundle-premium`
  - All wavelet functionality now in `morphiq-wavelets`
  - Shared utilities and position management in `morphiq-common`
  
- **Position Management Improvements**:
  - Converted Order Type from string constants to OrderType enum
  - Moved all position management code to `morphiq-common`
  - Better type safety and maintainability

## Previous Updates (August 2024)

### Strategy Signal System Refactoring (August 14, 2024)
- **Position Tracking Improvements**:
  - Replaced manual position tracking (hasPosition/isLong) with OrderContext-based tracking
  - Added helper methods: `hasPosition(ctx)`, `isLong(ctx)`, `isShort(ctx)`, `getPosition(ctx)`
  - Strategy now uses OrderContext as single source of truth for position state
  - Improved thread safety by relying on MotiveWave's position management

- **Signal System Changes**:
  - Changed from action-based signals (LONG_ENTER, SHORT_ENTER) to state-based signals (LONG, SHORT)
  - Removed FLAT_EXIT signal entirely - study only reports market state
  - Strategy decides entry/exit actions based on state signals
  - Proper separation of concerns: study reports state, strategy makes trading decisions

- **Bracket Order Implementation**:
  - Standardized bracket orders for both long and short entries
  - Removed ENABLE_BRACKET_ORDERS setting - bracket orders are now mandatory
  - Each entry creates three orders with unique UUIDs:
    - Market order for entry
    - Stop loss order at calculated stop price
    - Take profit order at calculated target price
  - Consistent order submission using `ctx.submitOrders()`

- **Entry Logic Updates**:
  - Long state signal: enters long if flat, exits short then enters long if short
  - Short state signal: enters short if flat, exits long then enters short if long
  - Prevents duplicate entries in same direction
  - Automatic position reversal on opposite signals

### Documentation Corrections & Performance Optimization (August 13, 2024)
- Fixed slope threshold documentation across all files
- Clarified that Min Slope Threshold is in absolute price points, NOT percentage
- Updated market-specific configurations with correct units
- Major optimization of VectorWaveSwtAdapter.reconstruct() method:
  - **Eliminated deep copy**: Now works directly with original MutableMultiLevelMODWTResult
  - **Removed unnecessary conversion**: No more toImmutable() -> new MutableMultiLevelMODWTResultImpl()
  - **Temporary modification strategy**: Zeros coefficients, reconstructs, then restores
  - **Significant performance gain**: Avoids expensive object allocation on every reconstruction
  - **Memory efficient**: Only allocates small arrays for coefficient backup
- Fixed non-deterministic test behavior in VectorWaveSwtAdapterTest
  - All test methods now use the seeded Random instance
  - Ensures consistent, reproducible test results
- Clarified testing approach for calculateFinalQuantity method
  - Method exists and is package-private (accessible to tests in same package)
  - Core logic tested via static calculatePositionSize method
  - Integration tests handle full SDK initialization separately
  - Removed duplicate test file (CalculateFinalQuantityTest.java)
- Enhanced thread safety in WaveletAtr.calculate() method:
  - Now makes defensive copies of input arrays to prevent concurrent modification issues
  - Protects against ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException from external array modifications
  - Verified with comprehensive concurrent access tests (5000+ operations)
  - Maintains performance while ensuring correctness

### Trade Lots Integration
- Fixed Trade Lots multiplication in `SwtTrendMomentumStrategy`
- Final position = Position Size Factor √ó Trade Lots
- Comprehensive logging of position calculations

### Momentum Oscillator Enhancement
- Added 100x scaling factor for better visibility
- Updated default threshold from 0.01 to 1.0
- Increased EMA smoothing alpha to 0.5
- Expanded momentum window to 10 bars

### Thread Safety Improvements
- All buffer operations synchronized with `bufferLock`
- Momentum state declared `volatile`
- WATR calculations use `stateLock` synchronization

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved JavaFX NullPointerExceptions
- Fixed Maven Shade overlapping class warnings
- Removed Point Value Override (now auto-detected)
- Fixed order fill validation
- Fixed slope threshold from 0.001 to 0.05 (50x increase for proper signal generation)

### Code Quality Improvements
- Removed ~65 lines of dead code from SwtTrendMomentumStrategy
- Preserved P&L tracking logic in docs/REFERENCE_PNL_TRACKING.md for future reference
- Optimized VectorWaveSwtAdapter.reconstruct() to cache adapter and reduce object creation
  - Caches VectorWaveSwtAdapter instance to avoid recreation
  - Tracks last reconstruction level to avoid unnecessary MutableMultiLevelMODWTResult recreations
  - Reduces GC pressure in high-frequency scenarios (called on every bar update)

## MotiveWave Development Reference Documentation

When developing MotiveWave studies and strategies, **ALWAYS consult these comprehensive reference documents**:

### üìö Required Reading for MotiveWave Development

1. **`docs/MOTIVEWAVE_PATTERNS_AND_PRACTICES.md`**
   - Study structure patterns and best practices
   - Initialization, calculation, and settings patterns
   - Strategy implementation patterns
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Signal generation and marker management
   - State management best practices

2. **`docs/MOTIVEWAVE_SDK_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md`**

    - 1,000,000+: Detailed local testing with stable results

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/maven.yml`):
- Two-stage pipeline: build and test
- Requires GITLAB_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN secrets
- Uploads artifacts for distribution
- Maven settings configured for GitHub Packages and GitLab Maven repositories

## Development Notes

### MotiveWave Study Development
- Studies must implement `com.motivewave.platform.sdk.study.Study`
- Use `StudyDescriptor` for configuration
- Override `calculate()` method for main logic
- Access price data via `DataContext`

### Wavelet Processing
- Core processing in `morphiq-wavelets` module
- Supports multiple wavelet types (Daubechies4, Daubechies6)
- Automatic parallel processing for performance
- Handles non-power-of-two data lengths

### Future Features
The `CUSTOM_WAVELET_DESIGN.md` outlines advanced features including:
- Custom ES/NQ microstructure-optimized wavelets
- Machine learning integration for coefficient optimization
- Real-time market regime adaptation
- Multi-scale wavelet families

### Important Files
- Parent POM: `/pom.xml` - manages all dependencies and plugin versions
- Common utilities: `/morphiq-common/src/main/java/com/morphiqlabs/common/`
- SWT Strategy: `/morphiq-wavelets/src/main/java/com/morphiqlabs/wavelets/swt/`
- Documentation: `/docs/SWT_TREND_MOMENTUM_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## Important Considerations

### When Working with Settings
- **Momentum Threshold**: Now scaled by 100x (use 1.0 instead of 0.01)
- **Min Slope Threshold**: Absolute price points (0.05 = 0.05 point minimum move, NOT percentage)
  - FIXED: Changed from percentage-based to absolute points
  - 0.00 disables filtering, 0.05-0.10 typical for ES futures
- **Trade Lots**: Properly multiplies position size
- **Point Value**: Auto-detected from instrument (ES=$50, NQ=$20)

### Thread Safety Requirements
- Always synchronize buffer operations with `bufferLock`
- Mark momentum-related fields as `volatile`
- Use separate lock objects for different state groups
- Never call `clearFigures()` outside `onSettingsUpdated()`

### Maven Build Configuration
- Use `shadedArtifactAttached=true` to avoid JAR conflicts and overlapping class warnings
- Classifier `motivewave` creates separate shaded JAR for MotiveWave deployment
- Dependencies included: morphiq-common, vector-wave, slf4j
- Shaded JAR includes all necessary dependencies for MotiveWave

### Testing Best Practices
- Use instance-specific Random with fixed seeds
- Test thread safety with parallel execution
- Verify Trade Lots multiplication
- Check momentum scaling (100x factor)
