# Morphiq Suite for MotiveWave

Professional wavelet-based trading indicators and strategies for the MotiveWave platform, powered by VectorWave's high-performance wavelet transforms.

## Overview

Morphiq Suite provides advanced wavelet analysis tools for systematic trading:
- **SWT/MODWT Implementation** - Undecimated transforms for shift-invariant analysis
- **Cross-Scale Momentum** - Multi-resolution signal confirmation with 100x scaled oscillator
- **Adaptive Denoising** - Three thresholding methods (Universal, BayesShrink, SURE)
- **Wavelet-ATR (WATR)** - RMS energy-based volatility estimation from detail coefficients
- **Real-time Performance** - Optimized sliding window buffers and parallel processing
- **Position Management** - Advanced order tracking with multi-order support and bracket orders

## Indicators & Strategies

### ðŸ“ˆ SWT Trend + Momentum
Complete trading system using Stationary Wavelet Transform:
- **Study**: Overlay indicator with trend line and momentum oscillator
- **Strategy**: Automated trading with bracket orders and position sizing
- **Features**: State-based signals (LONG/SHORT), RMS energy momentum, WATR-based stops
- **Enhancements**: 100x momentum scaling, Trade Lots integration, thread-safe buffers
- [Full Documentation](docs/SWT_TREND_MOMENTUM_DOCUMENTATION.md)

### ðŸ“Š AutoWavelets
Multi-level wavelet decomposition visualization:
- Real-time decomposition across multiple scales
- Dynamic level adjustment based on timeframe
- Visual representation of market structure

### ðŸ”‡ Denoised Trend Following
Classic wavelet denoising for cleaner price action:
- Adaptive noise reduction
- Preserves important market moves
- Reduced false signals in choppy markets

## Technical Features

### Wavelet Families
- **Daubechies** (db4, db6): Smooth, good for trends
- **Symlets** (sym4, sym6): Near-symmetric, balanced
- **Coiflets** (coif2, coif4): Compact support
- **Haar**: Simple, good for breakouts

### Advanced Algorithms
- **Thresholding Methods**: Universal, BayesShrink, SURE
- **Shrinkage Types**: Soft and hard thresholding
- **Sliding Window**: Efficient streaming updates with 512-bar buffer
- **Cross-Scale Analysis**: Multi-resolution momentum confirmation
- **Position Sizing**: Factor-based with Trade Lots multiplication
- **Risk Management**: Automated bracket orders with stop loss and take profit
- **Order Management**: UUID-based tracking with OrderBundle for multi-order strategies
- **Position Tracking**: Real-time P&L, risk/reward ratios, and trailing stops

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 23+
- Maven 3.6+ (3.9+ recommended)

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Key Settings & Configuration

### Important Parameters
- **Min Slope Threshold**: Absolute price points (e.g., 0.05 = 0.05 point minimum move)
- **Momentum Threshold**: Now scaled by 100x (use 1.0 instead of old 0.01)
- **Trade Lots**: Multiplies the final position size
- **Point Value**: Auto-detected from instrument (ES=$50, NQ=$20, etc.)
