# Wavelet Trading Strategies

This document details the planned wavelet-based trading strategies for the MotiveWave platform. Each strategy leverages different aspects of wavelet analysis to provide traders with actionable insights.

## Overview

Wavelet transforms decompose price data into multiple time-frequency components, revealing hidden patterns and relationships that traditional indicators miss. Our strategies exploit these multi-scale insights for improved trading decisions.

## Implemented Strategies

### 1. AutoWavelets (‚úÖ Completed)
**Purpose**: Provide adaptive multi-scale price decomposition

**Key Features**:
- MODWT (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform) using Daubechies4
- Dynamic decomposition levels (1-7) based on chart timeframe
- Auto-scaling to target ~390 minute trading sessions
- Real-time path management - only active levels displayed

**Trading Applications**:
- Identify trend direction at multiple timeframes simultaneously
- Filter out market noise to see underlying price movement
- Spot divergences between short-term and long-term trends

## Core Wavelet Theory

### Transform Types
1. **DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)**
   - Pros: Computationally efficient, excellent for denoising
   - Cons: Sensitive to starting point (not shift-invariant)
   - Use case: Offline analysis, feature extraction

2. **MODWT (Maximal Overlap DWT)** ‚úÖ Currently Used
   - Pros: Shift-invariant, stable for real-time analysis
   - Cons: More computationally intensive than DWT
   - Use case: Real-time trading signals (our primary choice)

3. **CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform)**
   - Pros: Highly detailed time-frequency representation
   - Cons: Computationally demanding, redundant information
   - Use case: Visual analysis, pattern identification

### Wavelet Selection Guide
- **Haar**: Step function, excellent for detecting sharp price jumps
- **Daubechies (db4, db6)**: Balanced smoothness and structure capture ‚úÖ Currently Used
- **Symlets (sym4)**: Similar to Daubechies but more symmetric
- **Morlet**: Complex wavelet, ideal for oscillatory/cyclical patterns

### Decomposition Level Interpretation (1-minute bars)
- **Level 1 (D1)**: Tick-level noise, ultra-short volatility
- **Level 2 (D2)**: Short-term momentum bursts (2-4 minutes)
- **Level 3 (D3)**: Established short-term trends (5-10 minutes)
- **Level 4 (D4)**: Medium-term intraday trends (15-30 minutes)
- **Level 5+ (D5-D7)**: Longer intraday to daily trends
- **Approximation (A7)**: Underlying smoothed trend

## Planned Strategies

### 2. Denoised Trend Following ‚≠ê Priority
**Purpose**: Filter high-frequency noise for cleaner trend signals

**Implementation Plan**:
- Perform multi-level MODWT decomposition
- Zero out D1 and optionally D2 coefficients (noise removal)
- Reconstruct denoised price via inverse transform
- Apply traditional indicators (MA crossover, etc.) to clean signal

**Trading Logic**:
- Entry: Standard trend signals on denoised price
- Exit: Trend reversal on denoised price
- Stop Loss: Based on denoised price volatility

**Advantages**:
- Fewer false signals from market microstructure noise
- More robust trend identification
- Better risk/reward ratios

**MotiveWave Implementation**:
- Overlay original and denoised price
- Show removed noise component separately
- Color-code based on trend strength

### 3. Multi-Timeframe Energy Burst Detection
**Purpose**: Identify momentum injections at specific time scales

**Implementation Plan**:
- Calculate energy for each detail level: Œ£(coefficient¬≤) over recent window
- Monitor energy spikes relative to baseline
- Confirm with broader trend from approximation coefficients
- Generate signals when energy aligns with trend

**Trading Logic**:
- Entry: Energy spike in D2/D3 + trend alignment from A4
- Exit: Energy subsides or trend flattens
- Position Size: Scale with energy magnitude

**Energy Calculation**:
```java
double energy = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < windowSize; i++) {
    energy += coefficients[level][index-i] * coefficients[level][index-i];
}
```

**MotiveWave Visualization**:

- Monitor correlation strength at each frequency
- Detect divergences from historical coherence patterns
- Generate mean-reversion signals

**Trading Logic**:
- Entry: Coherence breakdown after sustained correlation
- Direction: Fade the instrument that diverged
- Exit: Coherence restoration or stop loss
- Risk: Position size inversely proportional to coherence

**Advanced Features**:
- Lead-lag analysis via phase relationships
- Dynamic hedge ratios from coherence strength

**MotiveWave Visualization**:
- 2D coherence plot (time √ó frequency √ó strength)
- Phase arrows showing lead-lag
- Divergence alerts

### 5. Wavelet Support/Resistance Detector

**Implementation Plan**:
- Monitor zero-crossings in detail coefficients (D1-D7)
- Track coefficient magnitude peaks as potential reversal zones
- Create horizontal lines at price levels with coefficient confluence
- Weight importance by decomposition level (higher levels = stronger S/R)

**Trading Edge**:
- Dynamic S/R levels that adapt to market conditions
- Multi-timeframe confirmation of key levels
- Early detection of level breaks through coefficient behavior

### 3. Wavelet Cycle Analyzer
**Purpose**: Extract and predict dominant market cycles

**Implementation Plan**:

### 5. Multi-Scale Trend Alignment
**Purpose**: Generate high-probability signals from multi-timeframe agreement

**Implementation Plan**:

- Weight signals by decomposition scale
- Generate confluence score (0-100%)
- Alert when alignment exceeds threshold

**Trading Edge**:
- Trade only when multiple timeframes agree
