## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Financial markets exhibit complex behaviors across multiple time scales, from high-frequency noise to long-term trends. Traditional technical analysis tools often struggle to separate signal from noise effectively, leading to false signals and suboptimal trading decisions.

The SWT Trend + Momentum Strategy addresses these challenges by applying wavelet analysis—a mathematical framework originally developed for signal processing—to financial time series. This approach provides superior decomposition of price movements into their constituent frequencies while maintaining critical timing information.

### 1.2 Objectives

This white paper aims to:
1. Explain the theoretical foundations of wavelet-based trading
2. Detail the strategy's implementation and signal generation logic
3. Demonstrate performance characteristics across various markets
4. Provide guidance for practical deployment

### 1.3 Key Innovations

Unlike conventional moving average or oscillator-based strategies, our approach offers:

- **Multi-resolution analysis**: Simultaneous examination of multiple time scales
- **Shift invariance**: Consistent signals regardless of data alignment
- **Adaptive thresholding**: Market-aware noise reduction
- **Cross-scale validation**: Momentum confirmation across frequency bands

---

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Wavelet Transform Theory

#### 2.1.1 Continuous vs. Discrete Wavelets

The wavelet transform decomposes a signal into scaled and translated versions of a mother wavelet ψ(t):

```
W(a,b) = ∫ f(t) · (1/√a) · ψ((t-b)/a) dt
```

Where:
- `a` = scale parameter (frequency)
- `b` = translation parameter (time)
- `f(t)` = input signal

#### 2.1.2 The Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT)

The SWT, also known as the undecimated or redundant wavelet transform, addresses a critical limitation of the standard discrete wavelet transform (DWT): shift variance. 

Key properties:
- **Redundancy**: Maintains original data length at each level
- **Shift invariance**: Consistent decomposition regardless of starting point
- **Perfect reconstruction**: Lossless transformation

The SWT decomposition:
```
f(t) = A_J(t) + Σ(j=1 to J) D_j(t)
```

Where:
- `A_J` = Approximation at level J (smooth trend)
- `D_j` = Detail coefficients at level j (oscillations)

### 2.2 Financial Market Application

#### 2.2.1 Multi-Scale Market Structure

Financial markets exhibit distinct behaviors at different scales:
- **Micro-structure** (Level 1-2): Tick noise, bid-ask bounce
- **Short-term** (Level 3-4): Intraday patterns, momentum
- **Medium-term** (Level 5-6): Swing trading opportunities
- **Long-term** (Level 7+): Fundamental trends

#### 2.2.2 Noise vs. Signal

Traditional approaches use fixed lookback periods, missing the multi-scale nature of markets. Wavelets naturally separate:
- **Noise**: High-frequency details (D₁, D₂)
- **Signal**: Lower-frequency details and approximation (D₃+, A_J)

### 2.3 Wavelet Selection Criteria

Different wavelets suit different market conditions:

| Wavelet Family | Characteristics | Best For |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Haar | Sharp, minimal support | Breakout detection |
| Daubechies | Smooth, good frequency localization | Trend following |
| Symlets | Nearly symmetric, smooth | General purpose |
| Coiflets | Symmetric, vanishing moments | Range-bound markets |

---

## 4. Signal Generation Methodology

### 4.1 Trend Extraction

The low-lag trend is derived from the approximation coefficients A_J:

```java
trend[t] = A_J[t]  // Direct approximation
// OR
trend[t] = IDWT(A_J + Σ(thresholded D_j))  // Denoised reconstruction
```

### 4.2 Cross-Scale Momentum

Momentum combines information from multiple detail levels:

```java
momentum = Σ(j=1 to k) weight[j] × energy[j] × sign[j]
```

Where:
- `weight[j] = 1.0 / (1.0 + (j-1) × 0.5)` - Level weighting
- `energy[j] = RMS(D_j[window])` - Recent energy
- `sign[j] = sgn(mean(D_j[window]))` - Direction

### 4.3 Signal Logic

State signals are generated when both conditions align:

**LONG State**:
```
slope > minSlopeThreshold AND momentum > momentumThreshold
```

**SHORT State**:
```
slope < -minSlopeThreshold AND momentum < -momentumThreshold
```

### 4.4 Thresholding Methods

Three adaptive thresholding approaches for noise reduction:

#### 4.4.1 Universal Threshold
```
λ = σ × √(2 × log(n))
```
Conservative, works well in all conditions.

#### 4.4.2 BayesShrink
```
λ = σ² / σ_Y
```
Adaptive to signal-to-noise ratio.

#### 4.4.3 SURE (Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate)
Minimizes mean squared error, optimal for clean trends.

## 5. Risk Management Framework

### 5.1 Wavelet ATR (WATR)

Traditional ATR fails to capture multi-scale volatility. WATR addresses this:

```java
WATR = √(Σ(j=1 to k) weight[j] × ||D_j||²) × scalingFactor
```

Benefits:
- Scale-aware volatility measurement
- Frequency-specific risk assessment
- Adaptive to market conditions

### 5.2 Position Sizing

Risk-based position sizing ensures consistent exposure:

```
Position Size = min(
    MaxRisk / (StopDistance × PointValue),
    BasePositionSize
) × TradeLots
```

### 5.3 Bracket Order Structure

Every entry includes:
1. **Market Order**: Immediate entry
2. **Stop Loss**: WATR-based or fixed
3. **Take Profit**: Risk/reward multiple

Stop placement:
```
Long Stop = Entry - max(min(WATR × multiplier, maxStop), minStop)
Short Stop = Entry + max(min(WATR × multiplier, maxStop), minStop)
```

## 6. Performance Analysis

### 6.1 Backtesting Methodology

The strategy should be evaluated across:
- **Markets**: Major futures (ES, NQ), forex pairs, and other liquid instruments
- **Timeframes**: Multiple timeframes from 1-minute to daily
- **Market Conditions**: Including trending, ranging, and volatile periods
- **Parameters**: Optimized for each specific market

### 6.2 Performance Metrics Framework

Key metrics to evaluate:
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
- **Drawdown Analysis**: Maximum and average drawdown
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / gross loss
- **Risk/Reward Ratios**: Average winner vs. average loser

### 6.3 Market Regime Considerations

Performance should be analyzed across different market regimes:
- **Trending Markets**: Expected to show strongest performance
- **Ranging Markets**: May require parameter adjustments
- **Volatile Markets**: WATR adaptation should help maintain consistency

*Note: Actual performance results will vary based on specific implementation, market conditions, and parameter selection. Users should conduct their own backtesting before live deployment.*

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Mathematical Foundations

#### A.1 Proof of SWT Shift Invariance

The SWT maintains shift invariance by avoiding the downsampling step of the DWT. For a signal x[n] shifted by τ:

```
SWT{x[n-τ]} = SWT{x[n]} shifted by τ
```

This property ensures consistent signal decomposition regardless of the starting point, critical for real-time trading applications.

#### A.2 Wavelet Energy Conservation

The Parseval's theorem for wavelets states:

```
||f||² = ||A_J||² + Σ(j=1 to J) ||D_j||²
```

This energy conservation property allows us to measure signal strength across scales without information loss.

#### A.3 Threshold Selection Derivations

**Universal Threshold**: Derived from the minimax principle, ensuring the maximum risk is minimized:

```
λ_universal = σ √(2 log n)
```

where σ is estimated using the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the finest scale coefficients.
