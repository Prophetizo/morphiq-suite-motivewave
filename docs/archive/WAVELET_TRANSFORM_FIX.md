# Wavelet Transform Fix Summary

## Issue (Historical - Now Resolved)
The `forwardTransform` and `reverseTransform` methods in `WaveletAnalyzer` were returning empty arrays (length 0) instead of properly transformed data. The test was expecting 512 elements but received 0.

## Root Cause (Historical)
JWave's `MODWTTransform` class did not implement the reverse transform functionality in earlier versions. When calling `modwtTransform.reverse()`, it returned an empty array because "Reverse MODWT (iMODWT) is not implemented" in JWave.

## Current Status (JWave 1.0.7-SNAPSHOT)
✅ **RESOLVED**: JWave 1.0.7-SNAPSHOT now correctly implements inverse MODWT (`inverseMODWT` method), eliminating the need for custom workarounds.

## Solution
Modified `WaveletAnalyzer` to use `FastWaveletTransform` instead of `MODWTTransform` for the standard forward/reverse transform operations:

1. Added `FastWaveletTransform` instance to the class
2. Created separate `ParallelTransform` instance for FWT operations
3. Updated `forwardTransform()` to use FWT instead of MODWT
4. Updated `reverseTransform()` to use FWT instead of MODWT
5. Updated `shutdown()` method to clean up both parallel transform instances

## Key Changes in WaveletAnalyzer.java

### Added Fields
```java
private final FastWaveletTransform fwtTransform;
private final ParallelTransform parallelFwtTransform;
```

### Updated Constructor
```java
this.fwtTransform = new FastWaveletTransform(wavelet);
this.parallelFwtTransform = new ParallelTransform(fwtTransform, PARALLEL_THREADS);
```

### Updated Methods
- `forwardTransform()` now uses `fwtTransform` or `parallelFwtTransform`
- `reverseTransform()` now uses `fwtTransform` or `parallelFwtTransform`
- Both methods maintain the parallel processing threshold logic

## Why This Works
- `FastWaveletTransform` fully implements both forward and reverse transforms
- `MODWTTransform` is still used for MODWT-specific operations (`performForwardMODWT`)
- The custom inverse MODWT implementation (`performInverseMODWT`) continues to work for denoising

## Test Results
All tests now pass successfully, including:
- `ParallelProcessingTest.testForwardAndReverseTransforms` ✓
- All `WaveletDenoiserTest` tests ✓
- All other existing tests ✓

## Important Notes
- MODWT (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform) and standard DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform via FastWaveletTransform) are different algorithms
- MODWT is translation-invariant and better for certain applications like denoising
- Standard DWT is faster and has perfect reconstruction properties
- The `WaveletAnalyzer` class maintains both capabilities:
  - MODWT for denoising operations (using JWave's native `inverseMODWT`)
  - Fast DWT for general forward/reverse transforms

## Update (July 2025)
- Removed custom inverse MODWT implementation
- Now using JWave 1.0.7-SNAPSHOT's native `inverseMODWT` method
- This should improve accuracy, especially for non-power-of-2 signal lengths
