# VectorWave Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to replace JWave-Pro with VectorWave in the Morphiq Suite MotiveWave project. The migration involves implementing wavelet transforms, denoising capabilities, and ensuring compatibility with existing trading indicators.

## Current State Analysis

### Core Functionality Requirements

1. **Wavelet Types** (from WaveletType.java):
   - Haar (simplest wavelet for breakout detection)
   - Daubechies2 (fast response for HFT)
   - Daubechies4 (general purpose, 4 vanishing moments)
   - Daubechies6 (smoother, 6 vanishing moments)
   - Symlet4 (minimal phase distortion for trend analysis)
   - Symlet8 (better trend preservation)
   - Coiflet3 (smooth trend extraction for position trading)

2. **Transform Operations** (from WaveletAnalyzer.java):
   - Forward MODWT (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform)
   - Inverse MODWT reconstruction
   - Parallel processing for datasets â‰¥ 512 points
   - Standard forward/reverse wavelet transforms
   - Non-power-of-two data handling

3. **Denoising Capabilities** (from WaveletDenoiser.java):
   - Hard and soft thresholding
   - Adaptive thresholding based on market volatility
   - Complete zeroing of specified noise levels
   - Approximation extraction (smooth trend)
   - Configurable noise levels (D1, D2, etc.)
   - MAD-based threshold calculation

4. **Usage Patterns**:
   - **AutoWavelets**: Uses performForwardMODWT() to decompose price data into multiple levels
   - **DenoisedTrendFollowing**: Uses denoise(), denoiseByZeroing(), and getApproximation()

## VectorWave API Requirements

### 1. Core Wavelet Interface

```java
package ai.prophetizo.vectorwave;

public interface Wavelet {
    String getName();
    double[] getForwardCoefficients();
    double[] getReverseCoefficients();
    int getFilterLength();
    int getVanishingMoments();
}
```

### 2. Wavelet Implementations

```java
package ai.prophetizo.vectorwave.wavelets;

public class HaarWavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
public class Daubechies2Wavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
public class Daubechies4Wavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
public class Daubechies6Wavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
public class Symlet4Wavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
public class Symlet8Wavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
public class Coiflet3Wavelet implements Wavelet { ... }
```

### 3. Transform Classes

```java
package ai.prophetizo.vectorwave.transforms;

public class MODWTTransform {
    private final Wavelet wavelet;
    
    public MODWTTransform(Wavelet wavelet) { ... }
    
    public double[][] forwardMODWT(double[] data, int levels) { ... }
    public double[] inverseMODWT(double[][] coefficients) { ... }
}

public class FastWaveletTransform {
    private final Wavelet wavelet;
    
    public FastWaveletTransform(Wavelet wavelet) { ... }
    
    public double[] forward(double[] data) { ... }
    public double[] reverse(double[] coefficients) { ... }
}

public class ParallelTransform {
    private final Transform baseTransform;
    private final int numThreads;
    
    public ParallelTransform(Transform transform, int threads) { ... }
    
    public double[] forward(double[] data) { ... }
    public double[] reverse(double[] coefficients) { ... }
    public void shutdown() { ... }
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Algorithm Accuracy
- MODWT implementation must handle non-dyadic (non-power-of-two) lengths
- Circular convolution for translation invariance
- Proper scaling factors for energy preservation

### 2. Performance Optimization
- SIMD vectorization for filter operations
- Cache-friendly memory access patterns
- Efficient parallel work distribution
- Consider GPU acceleration for large datasets

### 3. API Compatibility
- Maintain similar method signatures to JWave where possible
- Use similar exception handling patterns
- Preserve existing logging behavior

### 4. Trading-Specific Features
- Zero-lag considerations for real-time trading
- Minimal latency for HFT applications
- Stability under market stress conditions
- Proper handling of gaps and missing data

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Keep old code commented until VectorWave is fully validated
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Maintain test suite coverage

2. **Performance Regression**
   - Benchmark against JWave implementation
   - Profile critical paths
   - Optimize hot spots

3. **Numerical Stability**
   - Validate against reference implementations
   - Test with extreme market conditions
   - Implement sanity checks for coefficient values

## Success Criteria

1. All unit tests pass with VectorWave implementation
2. Performance equals or exceeds JWave (especially for parallel processing)
3. Trading indicators produce equivalent results
4. Memory usage remains stable during extended runs
5. No regression in calculation accuracy

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-3**: VectorWave core development
- **Week 4**: Morphiq integration and testing
- **Week 5**: Performance optimization and documentation
- **Week 6**: Final validation and deployment preparation

Total estimated time: 6 weeks for complete implementation and validation.
