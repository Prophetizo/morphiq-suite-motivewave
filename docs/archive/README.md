## VectorWave Migration Archive (`vectorwave-migration/`)

Contains historical documentation from the VectorWave migration process (2025):

### Planning Documents
- `VECTORWAVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Original 6-week implementation plan
- `VECTORWAVE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Revised 5-day integration plan  
- `VECTORWAVE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Initial API gap analysis
- `VECTORWAVE_REVISED_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Modern architecture approach
- `VECTORWAVE_MODERN_APPROACH.md` - Modern integration strategy

### Architecture Documents
- `MOTIVEWAVE_REALISTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` - MotiveWave-compatible patterns
- `MORPHIQ_INTEGRATION_GITHUB_ISSUE.md` - Epic GitHub issue for service layer architecture

### Issue Templates
- `VECTORWAVE_GITHUB_ISSUE.md` - GitHub issue template for VectorWave integration

## Purpose

These documents were created during the migration from JWave to VectorWave and contain valuable historical context about:

- **Migration Strategy**: How the transition was planned and executed
- **Architecture Decisions**: Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Gap Analysis**: What features needed to be implemented or adapted
- **Integration Patterns**: MotiveWave-specific implementation details

## Migration Status

✅ **Migration Completed**: All JWave dependencies removed and replaced with VectorWave
✅ **Modern Architecture**: Service-oriented design with rich domain objects
✅ **Enhanced Features**: Market regime detection, trading style adaptation, quality metrics
